A regular neck exercise program will consist of stretching, strengthening, aerobic conditioning, and maybe even trigger point exercises.<br><br>When the neck, chest, and upper back muscles get weaker, tighter, or longer, the shoulders can round, and the head can fall forward. This bad posture, in turn, puts more stress on the facet joints, intervertebral discs, muscles, and ligaments of the cervical spine.<br><br>Additionally, poor posture can cause chronic or recurring neck pain, stiff joints, upper back pain, pain in the shoulder blades, and headaches when the head is too far forward. Luckily, a program of neck exercises may be able to help with most of these symptoms. Here are some chiropractor-grade exercises you can perform to Reverse Chronic Neck Pain and a Neck Hump. <br><br>A. STRETCHES<br><br>Flexibility and stretching exercises can help increase or keep the range of motion and elasticity in painful cervical (neck) joints, which can loosen stiffness caused by pain. Most of the time, it's best to stretch your neck daily, and some stretches can be done more than once a day. You can perform the following four stretching exercises to Reverse Chronic Neck Pain and a Neck Hump:</span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-ezbkAF A-dmbO pf-14_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-cLpAjG eSApOI pf-15_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-cTAqQK eHolsa pf-16_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-iWBNLc eCTOTm pf-18_">1.

Chin tucks are essential for relieving neck pain because they help realign neck muscles and relax them. When you do chin tucks, you reposition your muscles to their original position hence repositioning your head back to its original place. As a result, deep cervical flexors and extensors that get stretched when you have a neck hump relax, relieving you of neck pain. A beginner can perform chin tucks in the following straightforward manner:	<br><br>•	Maintain a straight back and look forward while positioning your ears so they are directly over your shoulders.<br>•	Put the tip of your finger on your chin.	<br>•	While keeping the finger in place, gently pull the chin and head back in a straight line until a comfortable stretch is felt at the back of the head and the top of the neck. (At this point, there should be a noticeable gap between the chin and the finger.)	<br>•	If you can, maintain this position for five seconds.	<br>•	Bring the chin back again until it is even with the finger.	<br>•	Perform the exercise a total of ten times, or as many times as is comfortable.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-ezbkAF A-dmbO pf-70_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-cLpAjG eSApOI pf-69_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-cTAqQK eHolsa pf-64_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-iWBNLc eCTOTm pf-63_">5.

The device will help reduce stiffness in your muscles and stretch them to relieve muscle pain and reposition your neck. Using this device is easy. Follow the following steps:	<br><br>•	Find a peaceful space where you can lie for about 10 minutes as you use the device	<br>•	Place your neck support on the device and start gentle traction with the convex side of the device under your neck. <br>	•	You can gently position your Neck Cloud™ Device up or down along your spine to ensure it is in the most comfortable position. After adjusting its position, bend your knees and place your hands beside your neck	<br>•	Take slow deep breaths as your neck settles further into the support	<br>•	Monitor how the support is reinforcing your posture. At this point, you may begin to notice you are releasing the tension	<br>•	Additionally, your posture may become more aligned as your neck, traps, and shoulders relax further	<br>•	Now, reposition yourself lightly every few minutes to prevent localized fatigue. If you prefer, you can assume your position	<br>•	Ensure you start slowly while taking a gentle support level for 5 minutes. After taking the level, you can determine if you can assume it for more minutes. Take note of your comfort and progress gradually. <br>	•	Sometimes, you may feel you need more neck support. In this case, use the concave side of the Neck Cloud Device.	<br>•	At first, you will feel discomfort as your muscles adjust to various poses. However, if you feel abnormal pain while using the device, please don’t continue using it before contacting a healthcare professional. <br>	•	Remember to regularly wash your device using warm water, liquid soap, or sanitizer if you notice a smell. Store it in a well-ventilated area for 24 to 48 hours.&nbsp;<br><br>The Neck Cloud™️ has been clinically proven effective in cervical traction to reduce neck pain. Cervical Traction is one of the most effective procedures for reducing neck pains. According to clinical results of randomized Controlled Trials by Heng-Dao Yang 1, Ka-Wai Tam, Tsai-Wei Huang, Shih-Wei Huang, and Tsan-Hon Liou, Hung-Chou Chen, patients who received intermittent cervical traction for neck pain using this device received significantly lower pain scores. Other clinical studies also indicate a 94.8% success of cervical traction and exercise in reducing chronic neck pain. In another clinical study, cervical traction was found to positively mitigate neck stiffness and tension by relaxing the neck muscles.The above clinical tests on the effectiveness of cervical traction in reducing neck pain and stiffness are evidence of the efficacy of Neck Cloud™️ - Cervical Traction Device by MassageLab, which will help you to achieve your desired neck posture and reduce your neck pain.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
